# async-stdio
A simple python library for creating applications that require asyncronous stdio.
The async-stdio library offers functionality similar to `netcat`'s line reader, moving the line down to allow printing while reading without breaking lines uglily.
For example usage, look at [the first example](/example1.py).

Currently there is no install script. You must install it by hand, or you can just copy `asyncstdio.py` (and license file) to your project directory.
